## Conversation
Andrej Karpathy created the repo nanochat. Here, our objective is to build nanochat for enterprises.

The following conversation was exchanged with Open Agent Manager in Antigravity.
```
Our objective is to build nanochat-enterprise, an AI-powered chat application for enterprise use. Currently all executions are happening from speedrun.sh, but we want to move to a more enterprise-ready setup. We would like to build a FASTAPI controller, could you help us with that?
```
response: 
```
That's great! I'm glad the new FastAPI controller meets your requirements.

The server is up and running in the background. You can now use the Enterprise Nanochat API to manage your training jobs remotely or locally with better process isolation.

If you need any help extending the API with more features (like real-time websocket logs or user authentication) or integrating it with a frontend, just let me know!

Happy coding! 🚀
